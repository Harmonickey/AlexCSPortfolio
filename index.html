<p>This includes some of my favorite computer science research.  I worked with the Astronomy Department at Northwestern University during my Freshman year during the summer.  I worked on the LALInference project, which was a gravitational wave estimation algorithm.  They needed the algorithm to perform at much faster speeds because they were waiting unreasonable amounts of time just to get the results from the data input.  Therefore, my project consisted of researching methods and implementing a way to speed up the processing.  I came up with a GPU Optimization algorithm that used CUDA 4.0.  I wrapped their main mathematical code and added a good amount of my own to run the optimization.  My implementation decreased their processing time by 40%.  I even added a separate optimization to another bottleneck but with OpenMP, which increased the percentage to 45%.  The code and research paper is below.</br>

<a name="class-projects" class="anchor" href="#class-projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Class Projects</h3>

<p>This is a list of my favorite and most challenging projects from my time at Northwestern.  They are not listed in any particular order.</p>

<p><em><strong>B+Tree</strong></em></br>
This project was to create a B+Tree in C++ in order to implement a database that stores key/value pairs.  The class was Intro to Databases.</br>
<a href="https://github.com/Harmonickey/AlexCSPortfolio/tree/master/Class%20Projects/B%2Btree">B+Tree Code</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Kernel Memory Allocator</em></strong></br>
This project was to create an operating system kernel memory allocator in C++.  It worked in the UNIX system and was a project for the Operating Systems course.</br>
<a href="https://github.com/Harmonickey/AlexCSPortfolio/tree/master/Class%20Projects/Kernel%20Memory%20Allocator">Kernel Memory Allocator Code</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Multithreaded Server</em></strong></br>
This project was for the Operating Systems course, and it was to create a small server that supported multithreading in C++ so that we could implement an airplane reservation system.</br>
<a href="https://github.com/Harmonickey/AlexCSPortfolio/tree/master/Class%20Projects/Multithreaded%20Server">Multithreaded Server Code</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Othello</em></strong></br>
This was a really fun project in the Intro to AI course.  I had to create an Othello computer player that would (ideally) never lose.  We implemented Alpha/Beta pruning, Backtracking, Forward Checking, and some other algorithmic techniques.  We had the option to create it in Python or C++, and I chose to implement it in C++.  This was the third large project in the class, with the first one being Tic-Tac-Toe and the second being Sudoku.</br>
<a href="https://github.com/Harmonickey/AlexCSPortfolio/tree/master/Class%20Projects/Othello">Othello Code</a></p>

<p><strong><em>TicTacToe</em></strong></br>
This was the first project in the Intro to AI course, and we implemented Backtracking and Forward Checking, which was enough to get the program to win or tie every time since the sample size wasn't too big (like Othello).  This was very fun to implement and was done in C++.</br>
<a href="https://github.com/Harmonickey/AlexCSPortfolio/tree/master/Class%20Projects/Tic%20Tac%20Toe">TicTacToe Code</a></p>

<p><strong><em>"Red-White-Blue" Political Database</em></strong></br>
This was a really cool web project which focused on the use of the SQL database.  We used SQLite3 (SQL), Javascript, Perl, and HTML to implement the project.  The goal was to aggregate certain political parties and show their statistics on a google map.  There were other small objectives such as creating a reliable and secure login methodology for the user which used the SQL database.  This was the first project in the Intro to Database Course.</br>

<p><strong><em>Sudoku Solver</em></strong></br>
This was the second main Intro to AI project.  Here we had to program a sudoku solver in C++ which could take in 9x9 to 25x25 boards and solve any of them within seconds.  We used Alpha Beta Pruning, Backtracking, and Forward Checking.  One of my favorite projects to implement.</br>

<p><strong><em>TCP Analysis Research</em></strong></br>
This was a really fun project in the Problems with Cloud Computing class.  We learned all about how the cloud works by reading and debating research papers.  We learned about tons of different techniques and methods to implementing cloud networks.  One of our main projects was to create a research proposal from one of the 8 problems described on the first day.  I chose to work with TCP Analysis.  We analyzed TCP connections for Ethernet, WiFi, Moving WiFi, Cellular Data Connections, and moving Cellular Data Connections.  We focused in the problem with why Cell Data is so much slower and drops connections more than WiFi.  Essentially, cell towers are just not up to date with current WiFi router standards.  I programmed the analysis code in Ruby.  My final paper and presentation are included here.</br>

<p><strong><em>Tiny Shell</em></strong></br>
This was a really fun project in Operating Systems that had us implement a bash shell in C++.  We had to implement a lot of the commands such as fg, bg, and alias.  We also had to implement IO indirection and piping.</br>
<a href="https://github.com/Harmonickey/AlexCSPortfolio/tree/master/Class%20Projects/Tiny%20Shell">Tiny Shell Code</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Ext2Cat Filesystem</em></strong></br>
This cool project in Operating Systems was to implement a ext2cat filesystem.  We used C++ and were able to implement all the block allocation algorithms that the project required and it ran the second fastest in our class competition.</br>
<a href="https://github.com/Harmonickey/AlexCSPortfolio/tree/master/Class%20Projects/ext2cat%20filesystem">Ext2Cat Filesystem Code</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Calendar</em></strong></br>
This was a simple project to help out with the Intro to Programming course.  I was a tutor, so I helped to create the key that was the Calendar program written in Python.  It should be able to move forward and backward in the calendar without problems.</br>
<a href="https://github.com/Harmonickey/AlexCSPortfolio/tree/master/Class%20Projects/Calendar">Calendar Code</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Spell Checker</em></strong></br>
This was a super fun project to test out data structures and algorithm analysis in my Data Structures and Management class.  We implemented a spell checker algorithm that used a double hash, and the hash function was a cyclic hash.  It would be able to check any word in under a second, basically as fast as Microsoft Word's spell checker.</br>

<p><strong><em>Http Client/Server</em></strong></br>
This was a C++ project in the Intro to Networking class.  The project tested us to implement a real client and server connection over IP.  We had to create our own IP packets in the client and capture them in the server.</br>

<p><strong><em>Routing Lab</em></strong></br>
In this C++ project we had to implement a routing network made of pseudo router connection points.  We had to use Djikstra's shortest path algorithm in order to find the shortest path for an IP packet to travel along the network.  This was another one of the neat projects from Intro to Networking.</br>

<p><strong><em>Boggle Solver</em></strong></br>
This was a Lisp project that solves boggle boards of any size, as long as it's size is a power of 2.  To solve it, it's assumed that the load function is called first to create a word trie from a crosswd.txt file of the dictionary of words.  Heavy recursion is used and common Lisp techniques.</br>

<p><strong><em>Crossword Helper</em></strong></br>
This was a Lisp project that helps the user with finding crossword words based on an entry into the solver function of the form "wa??" where the words returned would start with "wa" and end in various other two letters.</br>
<a href="https://github.com/Harmonickey/AlexCSPortfolio/tree/master/Class%20Projects/Crossword%20Helper">Crossword Helper Code</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Word Trie Structure</em></strong></br>
This was a Lisp project that creates an efficient word trie.  It can traverse the trie, insert new words, load a dictionary, and find words through query.</br>

<p><strong><em>Hatchu Show Ordering Program</em></strong></br>
My ballroom, latin, and swing team (BLAST) was having troubles coming up with a good show order with all the dance numbers that they had.  They had a few constraints, each half of the show needed to be a certain number of pieces, they needed to have no more than 2 of any style of dance, and each cast member cannot be in consecutive piece due to costume changes.  So I offered to create a program that creates possible show orders based on those constraints (and some other small ones).  I used my AI knowledge of a constraint satisfaction problem to solve the issue.  It takes in a cast list input, the user can create the dance numbers in the GUI, and the program outputs as many show orders as you'd like (provided that there are that many or more possible solutions).  It runs quite fast and is suprisingly cool for my first outside-of-class application of what I learned in school.  For a challenge, I wrote it in both Java and C#.</br>

<p><strong><em>Encryption/Decryption Program</em></strong></br>
This was a little C# project I made to implement some mathematical cryptography concepts I'd learned in my Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science course.  They didn't have a project for it, so I decided to try it out.  It implements rotating keys and modifies the input text file accordingly, which you can decrypt if you know the modulus and key that it gives you when you encrypted the file.</br>

<p><strong><em>Runge Kutta 2D/3D</em></strong></br>
This was practice for my Astronomy Research.  They gave me the task of computing planetary orbits using the Rugge Kutta algorithm.  First I used the 2D version, then implemented the 3D version.  It was cool to plot the points that output to the text file to a graphing tool and see the orbits take form!</br>

<p><strong><em>Project Euler Problems</em></strong></br>
I think doing the mathematical questions on projecteuler.net are pretty fun.  On my profile page are problems 2-25, all done in C#.  The problem descriptions can be found either in my documentation or on projecteuler.net.</br>

<p><strong><em>Find My Dog</em></strong></br>
This was a fantastic project with my Software Development class.  I had a group of 5 to work with and we developed a web app that was managed by some MBA students from the graduate program at Northwestern.  The collaboration was a really cool part, but also the development of a really cool product.  The Find My Dog app tracks your dog and can send you alerts when it moves outside of a particular radius after a certain amount of time.  It can also create reports based on how far you've been walking your dog.  This was all written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  The backend consisted of Firebase and Parse.</br>

<p><strong><em>DinMo</em></strong></br>
This was a web app created by me during the HackIllinois hackathon.  It is an API mashup between Yahoo, Parse, and Mashery's Rotten Tomatoes API.  The idea is that you are wanting a quick idea for a dinner and movie.  You input your zip code and it immediately suggests the best movie and dinner available near you.</br>

<p><strong><em>BundleUp</em></strong></br>
This was a project that my team put together during our Software Development course at Northwestern.  It was fun to figure out how to use the weather API involved and how to design a catchy looking app.  The app's main difficulty was to make it work for mobile as well, which it ended up doing very well.  The app can tell you what you should wear today or tomorrow based on weather conditions and future weather conditions.  It even knows exactly where you are automatically!  Bring an umbrella because it's going to rain later!</br>

<p><strong><em>BLAST (Ballroom Latin and Swing Team)</em></strong></br>
This is a wordpress website that I was conscripted to design and maintain for the Ballroom Latin and Swing Team on Northwestern's Campus.  It was fun to customize the php code and work with Wordpress plugins.  The website features slideshows, YouTube embedded videso, customized calendar views, and even a Javascript contact form.</br>

<p><strong><em>Shepard Residential Hall Website</em></strong></br>
This is a custom website built to show prospective students coming to Northwestern University how awesome living in Shepard Residential Hall can be!  It includes custom slide shows, custom designs, and custom overall layout.  It was challenging to create all the slideshows and display layouts, it was also very fun to figure out the best way to show off a dorm.  Our website won the residential hall website improvement award in the fall of 2013. </br>

<p><strong><em>Fluent Website</em></strong></br>
This is a fully customized website for a company in Austria that does translations.  I used Bootstrap and dynamic CSS to make sure that the design would hold over various differnet types of screens.  In addition, I created a mobile version which is highly bootstraped. When a user goes to the website, they are automatically redirected to the mobile subdomain if they're a mobile or tablet user. </br>

<p><strong><em>JAMGame and LbKStudios Game</em></strong></br>
This was actually one game with two separate parts that was essentially a top down shooter zombie game.  It was a test of my programming skills back in high school and a test of the graphic making skills of my other friends.  We coded everything from scratch but with using the XNA framework provided by Microsoft.  You could select any of four players and then start the game where you'd simply shoot zombies until you died or quit.  This game is really a testament to my programming ability, not necessarily the ability to create a good video game.</br>

<p><strong><em>Silhouetta</em></strong></br>
This was a concept game that we created through a group of friends.  It was essentially a platformer game but it never went to completion.  It stands as a testament to programming ability in C# and not much to the ability to make a video game.  It includes complex particle collision that helped the character jump around on platforms, and it included an extension that we called the Level Creation Software, which was used to help us create levels for the game.  The player was supposed to be able to invert the world and through which the player would be able to enter new realms that were seemingly invisible before.</br>

<p><strong><em>Silhouetta - Level Creation Software</em></strong></br>
This was a whole separate project that created levels from the Silhouetta game.  It created block worlds, in 2D.  In addition, the user had the ability zoom in and out.  The user could also import their own level blocks.  At the end, the user can save and import the levels into Silhouetta.  The user could save any of their progress at any time and even do test runs with their level (which called the Silhouetta runner in the background).</br>

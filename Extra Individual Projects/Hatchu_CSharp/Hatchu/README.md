Hatchu_Project
==============
This is a show ordering application.  The user simply inputs the Show Piece name, the Show Piece dance type, and the Show Piece cast.  Then Hatchu runs an algorithm that optimizes the show order based on constraints that include: not allowing two consecutive pieces to have the same cast member and not allowing for either half to have too many of a particular dance type.

INSTRUCTIONS:
There are two ways to use this application....  
1. You are starting from scratch.  2. You are loading a previous session.

1. You are starting from scratch.
  a. Type in how many pieces you are going to work with, then click "Create"
  b. Load a cast list by clicking File > Load Cast List
  c. Enter in the piece name, dance type, and cast members.
  d. Select how many pieces in the first half, the second half is implicit.
  e. Select how many of any dance type should be allowed in either half.
  f. Select how many solutions you'd like to display.  You'd probably not want every solution, that's too many, select something like 10 first.
  g. Select restart if you want to try for different solutions.
  h. If done, select File > Save Session and follow the instructions.
  
2. You are loading a previous session.
  a. Load your session by selecting File > Load Session

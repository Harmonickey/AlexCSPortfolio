                How we came to be: </br>
                </br>
                We rose out of a friendship of our founders. Early in the 10th grade, they enjoyed a Computer Programming class together. Without realizing it, our founders </br>
                became the closest of friends. a few months later, they decided to make games, apps, and utilities under a common name. We grew out of this.</br>
                </br>
                </br>
                How our name came to be: </br>
                </br>
                Originally, Saurutobi came up with a simple name: JAM. Since all three founders wanted their names represented, and all the initials were there, they decided </br>
                vertical lines to make the seperation clear. Therefore, J|A|Mstudios came to be. But, too many people and companies were associated with the word JAM; there </br>
                were no .coms free for jamstudios, either. The original website was hosted for free, because highschoolers are poor, under jamstudios.000webhost.com. on </br>
                December 3rd, Saurutobi decided to re-name, to be something new. He spent hours searching around, brainstorming. Finally, after nothing insane sprung from </br>
                his normally fruitfull mind, he asked the most creative person he knew. She took only 20 minutes, and returned with 'lazerbearswithkeyboards.org'. Seeing this </br>
                Saurutobi was insanely happy, but the name was long. One simple abbreviation later, and LbKstudios.net and to be. J|A|Mstudios still exists, but as a pet </br>
                project of the founders. </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                Who is Saurutobi?: </br>
                </br>
                The Director of LbKstudios. He takes the ideas he's presented with, refines them, and puts them into action. Most recently, he got annoyed with some code that </br>
                he had swapped, and had to copy and paste, a few times to swap the code back. He became annoyed with this, and decided to start a "Paste-Switcher". More info </br>
                can be found under the 'Ideas' tab. Saurutobi is the main person in charge of everything. he does the graphic design, the code, the ideas. He can do it all </br>
                but the specialists in their respective areas, Harmonickey-programming, Turtlegod0-graphics, take what he did and delve deeper, enriching it. </br>
                </br>
                Saurutobi is a complicated man. He was born in Germany, but moved to America in 1998. He has become the leader through hard work, and persistence. He has </br>
                become known for his intelligence and strength of mind. Being that as it is, he isn't the most likeable person in the work. His personality speaks far louder </br>
                than he can, and this has proven complicated, as he values personal strength and opinions, and those that do not voice themselves to him often, and rightly, </br>
                feel they are being disrespected and ignored. Very rarely does Saurutobi ask for someone's opinion, unless that someone is Harmonickey or Turtlegod0. He </br>
                prefers to be told what people think, which very often angers others because they don't like feeling ignored. His unique personality shapes who he is, and who </br>
                he surrounds himself with intelligent and talented people. Because of his strange tastes, he comes off as a complicated character most people except those of </br>
                the strongest willpower dislike.</br>
                </br>
                Saurutobi is a man with a music sense that would seem strange to anyone except his closest companions. He likes Showtek, Wildstylez, Headhunters, Psy, </br>
                Hardstyle, Brostep, Dance, and selective K-pop. He loves dancing, listening to music, watching movies, and generally enjoying life and the music. A few years </br>
                ago, he decided to start a techno-music podcast called Technoweek. Since then, Technoweek has been aborted for fear of DMCA violations and those repercussions. </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                Who is Harmonickey?: </br>
                </br>
                Harmonickey is Saurutobi's counterpart. Calm, collected, this man knows his programming. </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                Who is Turtlegod0?: </br>
                </br>
                Turtlegod0 brings up the trifecta. He is always calm and quiet, very respectfull of everybody. He is the go-to guy for graphics, having created the LbKstudios </br>
                logo and homepage graphics. While Saurutobi attacks all his graphic problems with MSPaint and Fireworks, Turtlegod0 uses Adobe's suite of graphic tools, to </br>
                create some of the most interesting graphics ever seen. </br>

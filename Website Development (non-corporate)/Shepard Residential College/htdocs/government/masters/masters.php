<p>I am a Professor in  the Psychology Department and the School of Education.  This will be my second term as Master of  Shepard, having previously served from 2003 until 2007.  I am very happy to be returning to Shepard.</p>
  <p> Shepard is a wonderful  place to live and work.  Two things stand  out:  First, we are very diverse group,  in every sense of the word.  Students  come from almost every College or School in the University, and you&rsquo;ll find  dozens of majors represented.  Second,  despite (or because of) our diversity, Shepard is a close community.  Students are genuinely interested in others,  devote a great deal of time philanthropy, and participate in many events  together. </p>
  <p>The focus on working  across fields is probably what attracted me to Shepard in the first place.  My research and teaching are very  interdisciplinary, focusing on how people learn from visual displays, such as  maps, graphs, and charts.  I study people  from age 18 months to well past college.   You can read more about my work at <a href="http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/uttal/">http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/uttal/</a> </p>
  <p> My job as Master is  primarily to help you meet faculty.  We  have an active and enthusiastic group of Faculty Fellows who come from many  different disciplines.  You&rsquo;ll have lots  of chances to meet them—at lunch in our dining room, at a dinner at a local  restaurant, or on one of the many trips we have planned to Chicago and other  locations.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to meeting you on move-in  day.</p>

	  Ph.D. student in Northwestern&rsquo;s Interdisciplinary Theatre &amp; Drama<br />

<p>I hail from the San Francisco peninsula, where I grew up being forced to play outside in an ever-present fogbank. In high school I decided to pursue a career in dance, and at age sixteen I packed up and moved away to a boarding school for the arts in a small town named Idyllwild, which is perched in the middle of the woods, high atop an isolated mountain in Southern California. Known for attracting a diverse collection of international young artists and budding eccentrics, Idyllwild was very influential in fostering my love for all things experimental, avant-garde, and creatively bizarre.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>I began dancing professionally shortly after graduating high school and finished my undergraduate work through a unique program for professional dancers run by St. Mary's College of California. I then moved on to do an MA in Performance Studies at NYU before arriving in Chicago in 2012 to continue my graduate work as a PhD student in the Interdisciplinary Program in Theatre & Drama. I am studying the history of dance notation systems as well as the process of documenting and reconstructing dances. At Northwestern I teach both theatre and dance, and center most of my coursework on experimental art and performance from the 1960s and '70s. I encourage you all to come join my classes, as we explore all the weirdness, retro-kitsch, and “what-the-what?” that makes up this wonderfully peculiar time. </p>
<p>Having spent many years in ballet, I am also a sucker for fairy tales, cheesy romances, and stories that make little to no sense. I continue to believe that all emotions can be conveyed through simple hand gestures and that everything always ends happily ever after, even if you are turned into a swan, fall in love with a life-sized doll, or are imprisoned in a magical castle by a man named Kashchei the Immortal.</p>
  <p>I am very much looking forward to meeting you!</p>

<h5>What do masters do?</h5>
<p>The Master is a senior faculty member who "guides the intellectual and programmatic life of each residential college." For example, he coordinates fellows' participation in an undergraduate research grant called the <a target="_blank" href="http://undergradresearch.northwestern.edu/research-opportunities/residential-college-fellow-assistant-researcher-award-fara">FARA</a>. Learn more about the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.northwestern.edu/residentialcolleges/masterstaff/index.html">Master staff</a>.</p>

<p>The Associate Master shares the responsibilities with the Master.</p>

<p>The Assistant Master is a graduate student who helps with administrative duties, like organizing cross-RC events. They are usually awesome.</p>
